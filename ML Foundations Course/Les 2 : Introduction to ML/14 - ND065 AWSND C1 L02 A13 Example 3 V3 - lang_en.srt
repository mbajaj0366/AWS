1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
Let's review example number 3.

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:04,975
In the past examples,

3
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:11,260
we use classical methods like linear models and k-means to solve machine learning tasks.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,610
In this example, we will see a more modern model type.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,145
You run a company which offers a specialized on-site janitorial services.

6
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:24,460
One of your clients and industrial chemical plant

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,255
requires fast response for spills and other health hazards.

8
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:33,250
You realize you should be able to mobilize your janitorial team

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,775
faster if you could detect the spills from the plant surveillance system.

10
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:42,775
You investigate using machine learning to perform this automatic detection.

11
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:48,665
You recognize you can represent this task as a supervised classification task.

12
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,960
Your goal will be to predict if each image belongs to a,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,925
contains a spill class or it does not contain a spill class.

14
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,860
Since you run the janitorial service,

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,300
it's pretty easy for you to stage safe for spills.

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,840
You quickly build a collection of images that contain

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,775
both the spills and non spills in multiple lighting conditions and environments.

18
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:16,720
Exploring and cleaning your dataset is pretty straightforward.

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,805
You quickly flip through all photos to ensure the spill is clearly in shut.

20
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:27,080
You split the images into a training dataset and test dataset.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,165
The surveillance system produces only grayscale images.

22
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:37,720
You convert the image to numeric data so the model can process the data.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,170
To demonstrate this, in this example of a dark liquidus spill,

24
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,470
you can see each pixel in the image on the left can be

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,635
represented in the image on the right by a number between zero and one.

26
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:55,750
Zero being completely black and one being completely white.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,400
Traditionally to solve this problem,

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,390
a human would have to manually label the features in the image.

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,760
For example, locations are prominent,

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,965
edges and corners in the image,

31
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:10,115
and then train a model on these features.

32
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:16,040
Today, deep neural networks are the most commonly used tool for the problems like this.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,010
These deep neural networks can learn

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,790
the features in an image as long as they have been labeled.

35
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,350
CNN or Convolutional Neural Network,

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,260
which is a common deep learning model for processing image,

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,250
is a good model choice for this task.

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,300
These neural networks are made up of many different types of layers.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,435
These layers are required for neural networks to train successfully.

40
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:48,005
The details of neural networks are beyond the scope of this lesson,

41
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:51,695
but we wanted to at least introduce the idea.

42
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:54,535
We will keep things high level for now.

43
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:59,170
You begin training to solve your classification task here.

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,180
As we saw in our last example,

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,170
there are also many options for the statistical metrics you can

46
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,480
use to help determine how effective your neural network model is.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,145
As you further explore machine learning,

48
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:17,105
you will learn to research and identify these metrics

49
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:22,025
and learn which one help you evaluate your model most effectively.

50
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,780
As we will see here,

51
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,190
precision and recall will be effective in this example.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,650
You stop and realize that accuracy might not be the best evaluation mechanism.

53
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,565
Defined as percentage of correct predictions,

54
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:42,655
you realize the model will see the newest spill class almost all the time.

55
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:49,310
Any model that just predicts no spill most of the time will be pretty accurate.

56
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,305
What you really care is an evaluation mechanism that really misses a real spill.

57
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:58,925
After doing some Internet search,

58
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,850
you realize this is a common problem.

59
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,450
You augment your accuracy valuation mechanism with

60
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,205
the evaluation metrics, precision and recall.

61
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:12,825
You can think of precision as answering the question,

62
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:16,845
of all predictions of a spill how many were right?

63
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,580
Or in this example,

64
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,075
how often will I be sending a janitor to clean an actual spill?

65
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:28,390
You can think of recall as answering the question of all actual spills,

66
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,415
how many did we detect?

67
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:31,959
Or in this example,

68
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,150
how many of these spills did my system catch?

69
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,745
You also realize your [inaudible] spills might not have been sufficiently

70
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,430
realistic and you really want to have

71
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,750
a good sense of how well your model will do when you use it.

72
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,050
You spend an hour searching through historical records of

73
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,110
the surveillance system and find a few cases are real spills.

74
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,005
You evaluate your model against this dataset

75
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,470
and convert that into performing satisfactorily.

76
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,585
Confident in these results,

77
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,990
you deploy this model on a system that enables

78
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,890
you to run machine-learning workloads on surveillance systems.

79
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,300
You implement a simple paging system and begin transitioning

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,530
your team to respond to these pages in addition to the typical routines.
