1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Let's walk through this lesson's outline.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,540
First, we will discuss what machine learning is and the common

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,590
terms and components involved in machine learning projects.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,460
You might know that machine learning involves using train models to

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,315
generate predictions or detect patterns from data.

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,985
But what is happening behind the scene?

7
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:26,880
In this section, we break down the different steps involved in machine learning.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,005
It's always important to connect theory to practice.

9
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,840
We will finish this lesson by providing

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,640
a real-world example of how machine learning is being used to solve problems.
