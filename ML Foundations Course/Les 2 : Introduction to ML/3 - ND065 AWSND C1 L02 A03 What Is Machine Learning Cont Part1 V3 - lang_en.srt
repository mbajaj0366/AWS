1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
To start, let's talk about the relationship between

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:08,085
artificial intelligence or AI and machine learning.

3
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:12,240
AI refers to the broad capability of machines to

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,770
perform activities using human-like intelligence.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,515
Machine learning, or short form,

6
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:22,860
ML, is a type of artificial intelligence.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,970
It allows computers to automatically learn and improve

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,935
from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

9
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:35,790
Using machine learning, computers can learn from

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,035
data to discover patterns and make predictions.

11
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,410
Supervised learning is a type of

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,280
machine learning technique in which every training sample from

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,915
the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it.

14
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:58,850
As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,660
You can use supervised learning to do things like predict

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,000
the sale price of a house or classify objects in an image.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,005
You will learn more about supervised learning in this lesson.

18
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:16,660
In unsupervised learning, there are no labels for the training data.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,860
The algorithm tries to learn

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,905
the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.

21
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:27,035
You will discover more about this technique later in this lesson.

22
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:31,115
Remember, in supervised and unsupervised learning,

23
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:35,039
models inspect data to discover patterns,

24
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,185
then human use the patterns learned by the model

25
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:41,890
to gain new understandings or make predictions.

26
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,405
There is another type of machine learning called reinforcement learning,

27
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:48,880
which takes a different approach.

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,090
Reinforcement learning is learning

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,845
what actions to take in a situation to maximize reward.

30
00:01:56,845 --> 00:02:00,460
It is similar to how you might train your pet.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,265
If your dog does something you want it to do,

32
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,735
you might reward it with a treat.

33
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,570
If it does something you don't want it to do,

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:14,600
you might correct it with a small penalty like raising your voice just a little bit.

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,660
Your dog learns to do the things that get

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,040
a treat and avoid doing things that get a correction.

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,040
In machine learning, reinforcement learning works exactly like this.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,875
Now, let's see how machine learning help solve problems

39
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:35,260
and how this differs from traditional problem-solving.

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,270
In traditional problem-solving with software,

41
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,920
a person analyses a problem and engineers a solution in code to solve that problem.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,025
For many real-world examples,

43
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,635
this process takes a lot of time.

44
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,990
It might even be impossible.

45
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,015
This is because a correct solution needs to consider numerous edge cases.

46
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:02,720
For example, imagine the challenging task of writing

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,800
a program which can detect if a cat is poisoned in an image or not.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,340
Traditional problem-solving would require careful attention to

49
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,610
details like varying lighting conditions,

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,080
different type of cats, colors, etc.

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,145
In machine learning, we have a flexible component called a model.

52
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,980
We also have a special program called

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,845
the model training algorithm to adjust the model to real-world data.

54
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:34,040
The result is a trained model which can be used to predict

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,185
outcomes which are not part of the dataset used to train it.

56
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:42,680
In a way, machine learning automate some of this statistical reasoning and

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,405
pattern matching that the problem-solver would traditionally do.

58
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,485
The flexibility of the model is the key here.

59
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:56,945
The machine learning field has seen rapid and recent growths.

60
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,200
As you start on your machine learning journey,

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,030
you might see related,

62
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,915
but different definitions of the terms we will use in this lesson.

63
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:11,945
This is because machine learning is a new field at the intersection of statistics,

64
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:15,470
applied math, and computer science.

65
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,750
Each of these fields might have

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,590
a slightly different formal definition for the same terms.
