1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,815
When your model produces the quality and accuracy you are looking for,

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:09,120
you can begin to use your model to solve the original problem.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,500
Once you have trained your model and evaluated its effectiveness,

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,225
you're ready to generate predictions from real unseen data in the field.

5
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,650
In machine learning, this process is often called inference.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,640
Keep in mind that you will always be monitoring to make sure

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,750
your model is producing the kinds of results that you're expecting.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,955
As we mentioned before,

9
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:35,700
there may be times where you re-investigate

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,240
the data or even choose a model type used for training.
