00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,255
Congratulations on completing this lesson.

2
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:05,880
We went through a lot of information to give you

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,045
a foundational understanding of machine learning.

4
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:13,680
Hopefully you now have a better sense of what machine learning is.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,950
Let's look back and see what we covered.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,540
We discussed machine learning as a complex subject area to understand what

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,550
machine learning is and what are

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,880
the common components involved in machine learning project.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,650
We also introduced you to

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,020
some most common terms and ideas that are used in machine learning.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,830
We discussed how machine learning involves using train models

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,190
to generate predictions and detect patterns from data.

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,090
We looked a bit behind the scenes

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,800
to break down the different steps involved in machine learning.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,320
In this section, we took you through a couple of

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,170
real-world examples which use machine learning

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,199
in different ways to solve real-world problems.
