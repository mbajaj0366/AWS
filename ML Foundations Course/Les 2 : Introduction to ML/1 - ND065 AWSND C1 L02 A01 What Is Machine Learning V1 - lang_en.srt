00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,405
Welcome to introduction to machine learning lesson.

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:07,215
I'm excited to be your instructor for this section.

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:13,709
Machine learning is creating reckless and exciting changes across all levels of society,

4
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,760
it's the engine behind the recent advancement in autonomous vehicles.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,734
It allows for a more accurate and rapid translation of text into hundreds of languages,

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:29,280
and it powers the AI assistants you might find in your home.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,050
We can also use machine learning to do things like improving

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,100
worker safety and a speeding up drug discovery.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,640
Machine learning Is a complex subject area.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,120
Our goal in this lesson is introduce you to some of

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,005
the most common terms and ideas used in machine learning.

12
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:53,045
I would then walk you through the different steps involved in machine learning,

13
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,940
and finish with a series of examples which

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,395
use machine learning to solve real-world situations.

15
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:03,850
There are a lot to cover. Let's get started.
