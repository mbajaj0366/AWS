00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,635
You have learned about the tasks of machine learning workflow.

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:08,910
Now, let's see what this actually looks like in real life.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,925
We are going to look at three case studies showing three types of machine learning tasks.

4
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:19,640
Supervised learning task, where we tried to predict housing prices for

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,460
homes in your neighborhood based on lot size and number of bedrooms.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,655
Unsupervised learning task where we try to use machine learning to find

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,830
interesting collections of books in

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,795
a book dataset based on descriptive words in the book description.

9
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:43,430
Finally, we will see a third case study where we use a more modern model called a

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,545
deep neural network to try to detect chemical spills in a lab from video and images.

11
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:54,740
While neural networks are beyond the scope of this lesson,

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,800
we felt it's worthwhile to touch on how they work.
