00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
Regardless of a specific model or training algorithm used,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,480
many people working in machine learning space use a common workflow.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,150
The steps in this workflow are: defining the problem,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,385
building a dataset, training the model,

5
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:21,510
evaluating the model, and using the model.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,565
The remainder of this lesson will be centered around each step in this process.

7
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:29,700
We will talk about different potential pain points and

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,540
common tasks machine learning practitioners do at each step.
