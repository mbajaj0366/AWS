00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
After we have collected our dataset and trained our model,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,995
we are ready to actually see how well our model works.

3
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,700
Let us start with an example.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,340
Let's say there is a dataset containing data on

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,530
many different aspects of flowers like petal lengths or color.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,730
Let's say you're building a model to determine if a flower is one

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,840
of two commonest species based on measurable details.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,760
You could use model accuracy or how often your model predicts

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,520
the character species to evaluate if

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,500
your trained model will be good at solving that task.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,615
To evaluate models, we often use a statistical metrics like accuracy.

12
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:48,875
Here are a few examples of different metrics that you can use.

13
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,605
Some are more common than others.

14
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:55,430
For example, precision or F1 score,

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,130
but there are more that you can explore.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,470
Please note that this is not a one-and-done process.

17
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,670
It's an iterative process until you get the results you're looking for.

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,790
Based on how the model evaluation goes,

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,040
you may find that you need to go back to previous steps that we discussed.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,670
You might need to change the configuration of parameters of

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,795
the training model or possibly even choosing different model.

22
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:28,510
You might have to tweak the model or make adjustments to your data.

23
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,730
You might even rethink how you are framing the problem.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,385
At some point, you will have a model which meets your need.

25
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:40,140
Now you can use the model.
