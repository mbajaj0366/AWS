1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first step in the machine learning workflow is to

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,510
define the machine learning problem you are trying to solve.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,370
You might be wondering,

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,940
how are we even to start to define a machine learning task?

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,150
First we define a very specific task.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,745
Think back to our snow cone example.

7
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,000
Now imagine that you own a frozen treat store,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,675
and you sell snow cones along with many other products.

9
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:27,900
You wonder, how do I increase sales?

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,540
This is not a specific task.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,280
It is too broad.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,905
A machine learning practitioner might frame the problem differently, such as,

13
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:41,370
does adding a dollar upcharge for sprinkles on

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,580
a hot fudge sundae increase the number of snow cones sold?

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,240
Or another example, does adding

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,450
a 50 cent upcharge for mixing flavors increase the number of snow cones sold?

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,330
Next, we want to identify the machine learning task we should use to solve this problem.

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,355
This will help us better understand the data we need for the proposed project.

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,705
You will look at some examples in more detail.

20
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:11,070
What exactly are machine learning tasks?

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,160
All model training algorithms and the models themselves take data as their input.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,710
The outputs, however, can be very different.

23
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,300
They can be classified into different groups based on the machine learning task.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,150
The characteristics of the input data actually

25
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,125
help define which machine learning task can be used.

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:37,565
Two common machine learning tasks are supervised and unsupervised learning.

27
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:42,035
We have reinforcement learning as well as we briefly talked about it before,

28
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,070
but you will learn about reinforcement learning in a later lesson.

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,520
One way to break down these machine learning task is

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,045
based on the type of data you need to train your model.

31
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:58,970
Most data can be described as either labeled or unlabeled data.

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,240
What's the difference?

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,605
Let's talk about supervised learning first.

34
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:08,185
We use the term labeled data to refer to data that

35
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:12,510
already contains the solution called labels.

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,070
Let's think back to our snow cone example.

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,980
What were we trying to predict?

38
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,330
We were trying to predict the number of snow cones we would sell.

39
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,340
Those data points are solutions or labels.

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,790
We use both the number of snow cones sold and

41
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,090
the temperature to generate the best fit line on the graph.

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,610
Another type of machine learning task is unsupervised learning.

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,305
As you might guess,

44
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:46,045
we call data unlabeled when we don't have the solutions or labels.

45
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:49,010
Let's look at a couple of examples here.

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,110
Take a quick look at this picture.

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,340
What do you see? Your first thought may be a tree.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,950
You just labeled this picture.

49
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,450
But a computer initially only sees that image as

50
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,990
a matrix of pixels which represents that image,

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,020
not the whole image.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,380
Here's another example.

53
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,395
Imagine that you work for a company that recommends book to readers.

54
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:21,590
To provide better recommendations to your readers,

55
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,225
you want to discover known microgenres.

56
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:29,405
You are fairly confident that these genres exist.

57
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:33,290
It would be impossible for you to read every book in

58
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,460
the world to ensure that the particular microgenre exists.

59
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,480
But words and phrases used in the book description might

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,670
provide some guidance on which microgenre a book belongs to.

61
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,155
Because you don't know which microgenre exists,

62
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:52,540
you cannot use supervised learning technique here.

63
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,420
You don't have labels.

64
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,820
Instead, you can use a common unsupervised learning technique called

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,730
clustering to determine if books have some natural grouping.

66
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,830
We will take another look at this example of

67
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,185
unsupervised learning in a real-world scenario later in this lesson.

68
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:16,260
Just as we initially divided task based on whether we had labeled data or not,

69
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,650
we can continue to further define the machine learning tasks based on the type of label.

70
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,710
Imagine that we trained a machine learning model to

71
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,255
predict a type of a flower based on images.

72
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:32,455
In this example, our label is categorical.

73
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,915
We are performing a classification task.

74
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:38,385
In our snow cone example,

75
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,150
we were trying to predict the number of snow cones

76
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,180
sold on a given day based on a temperature.

77
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,505
Our label is a number that could in theory be anything.

78
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:52,630
In that case, we are performing a regression task.

79
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,710
These are just two of the most common examples.

80
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,580
You will find many other types of

81
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,735
supervised learning task as you explore the machine learning space.

82
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,765
Similarly, with unsupervised learning,

83
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:10,475
you can further narrow the scope of the machine learning task you're working on.

84
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:13,070
In our book microgenre example,

85
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,575
clustering is one common application of unsupervised learning.

86
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:20,270
As you explore the machine learning space,

87
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,930
you will find many other types of unsupervised learning tasks,

88
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,580
such as neural networks.
