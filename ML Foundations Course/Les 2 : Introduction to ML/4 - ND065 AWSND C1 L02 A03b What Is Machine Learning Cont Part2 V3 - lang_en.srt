1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,645
Nearly all tasks solved with machine learning involves three primary components.

2
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:08,850
The Machine Learning Model,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,935
the Model Training Algorithm,

4
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:13,440
and the Model Inference Algorithm.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,755
These three parts are like the different stages

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:20,685
after crafting a teapot from a lump of clay.

7
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,105
First, you will start with block of raw clay,

8
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:26,715
which represents your machine learning model.

9
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,940
At this stage, the clay can be modeled into

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,129
many different forms and can be used to serve many different purposes.

11
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,030
You decide to use this lump of clay to make a tea pot.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,505
How do you create this teapot?

13
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:45,500
You inspect and analyze the rock clay and think about what to

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,720
change to make it look more like the teapot you have in mind.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,670
Much like the artist who gently make

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,510
adjustment to make their clay look more and more like a teapot,

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,690
the model training algorithm makes a small changes

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,280
to the model parameters so we achieve our goals.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,565
Now you've made your teapot.

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,165
It's been inspected, evaluated,

21
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,315
and now it's ready for your enjoyment.

22
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:13,435
You enjoy your teapot, drink your tea.

23
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:16,010
This represent model inference.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,120
Now your model is ready to be used in real world.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,420
A model is a generic program made specific by data used to train it.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,340
Like a piece of clay,

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,775
it can be modeled into many different forms and can serve many different purposes.

28
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,820
A more technical definition would be that

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,510
machine learning model is a block of code or framework

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,500
that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,520
In this example, we are using a linear regression model to

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,325
predict the number of the snow cones you might expect to sell based on the temperature.

33
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,774
Our model here predicts that as the temperature increases,

34
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:04,375
you will sell more snow cones.

35
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,030
A model can also be used to predict how the number of

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,350
people who attend college changes based on the costs of admissions.

37
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,830
In this example our model predicts that as the cost of tuition increases,

38
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,630
the number of people attending college will decrease.

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,045
But how does this model do this work?

40
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,295
That is what model training is for.

41
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:35,525
The procedure to use data to shape a model for some use cases is called model training.

42
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,770
There are many model training algorithms.

43
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,750
To understand how they work,

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,860
let's go back to our flexible lump of clay analogy for a machine learning model.

45
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,600
The first thing you would do is inspect and analyze the raw clay

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,780
and think about how to change it to look more like the tea pot you have in mind.

47
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,320
Similarly, a model training algorithm uses the model to

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,885
process data and then compares the results against a goal.

49
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:10,775
In this step, we determine what changes need to be made to get to that goal.

50
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:16,330
Now you shape the clay to make it look more like the tea pot you have in mind.

51
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,770
Similarly, a model training algorithm gently nudges a specific part,

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,440
in a direction that brings the model closer to achieving their goal.

53
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,015
You keep doing these two steps repeatedly.

54
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,320
Eventually, you get closer and closer to what you

55
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,675
want until you determine that you're close enough to stop.

56
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,090
Now you have your completed teapot.

57
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,075
It's been inspected and evaluated.

58
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:46,550
It's ready for your enjoyment.

59
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,950
What does this mean from a machine learning perspective?

60
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,070
We are ready to use the model inference algorithm to,

61
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,880
for example, generate predictions using the train model.

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,025
This process is often referred to as model inference.

63
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:07,460
We just described each of these steps in a bit more detail.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,135
Let's put it all together.

65
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,890
First, you start with a raw piece of clay

66
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,425
which can be modeled into many different things.

67
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:17,960
This represent the machine learning model.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,930
Next, you shape your raw piece of clay to make

69
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,130
it look like a tea pot that you always wanted.

70
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,380
Similarly, the model training algorithm gently

71
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,445
nudges parameters to make the model capable of solving the problem.

72
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:35,195
Finally, you can enjoy your teapot and put it to work.

73
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,325
This represent model interference.

74
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,500
You use your model to solve their problem.
